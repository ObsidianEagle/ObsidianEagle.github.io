So, I've finally gotten round to making my website an actual thing after sitting on it for so long. It's pretty bare right now, I still need to get around to adding some more detail as well as maybe some older projects I've done, but at least I've got a place to put things now.

I'm definitely not much of a blogger, but I've got plans for a couple of projects I plan to do over summer, so I'll probably talk about those in some detail when I get to them in these blog posts, as well as if I ever do something cool at a hackathon.
